# full_stack_weather_forecast

## Description

Welcome to the Weather Forecast App. With this app, you'll be able to search for the weather for a city, which will be stored to a list of pevious searches, and display the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast.

While working on this project, I was able to practice implementing a full stack application, utilizing TypeScript, Web APIs, fetch requests, GET, POST and DELETE methods, as well as fs methods to maintain a database file.
